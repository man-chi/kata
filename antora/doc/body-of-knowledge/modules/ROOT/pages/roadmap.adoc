== Problem Statement

.Metrics Model
image::Metrics-Model.svg[]


Statistics::
The software industry is still in crisis.
According to the Standish Group's CHAOS Report in 2018, only 29% of software projects were deemed successful, while 52% were considered over budget or delayed, and 19% were outright failures (abandoned or not used).<<2>>

Root Cause Analysis::
. Intent: setup for failure: unclear or even confused on external force of stakeholders, outcome, strategy and business model, leading incorrect goal setting and KPI.
. Design: failed before execution: conceptual business strategy is not concrete and realizable for technical execution. enterprise architecture required to bridge the huge gap.
. Process: too much focus on technology, tooling and programming language; dev team should focus on design, process, capability and governance.
. Measure: software developers spend up to 42% of work week dealing with technical debt and bad code. code quality measurement is required to provide transparency on complexity, allowing leadership to define policy, assess cost of delay and weighted shortest job first

Biggest Challenges::
. volatility
. uncertainty
. complexity
. ambiguity

== Valuation (capture, create and deliver values)

Ecosystem & Pressure (STEEPL)::
business must be designed to be agile due to natural uncertainty:
. Social: code complexity reflects aspect of social activities
. Technological: artificial intelligence has advanced as norm
. Economical: business are greatly depending on software
. Environmental: expecting more energy saving from code efficiency
. Political: code analysis for trade sanction
. Legal: as powerful tool in due diligence and M&A

Stakeholder(DRIVER) Analysis::
capture, create, deliver values to these drivers (direct & indirect interests)!!
. customers
. supplier
. employee
. owners
. community
. competitor
. enterprise
